This project is part of my DIY Sim racing series. It uses a modified hoverboard motor to create a powerful
direct drive FFB steering wheel!

There are two main folders, housing and motor. The housing folder contains the design and cut files for the housing components as well as the 3D model for the corner pieces.

The motor folder contains everything needed to complete the modification to the motor!
